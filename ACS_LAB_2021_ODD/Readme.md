# Introduction to optical communication systems simulation

## Optsim software package by Rsoft Corporation

**(www.rsoftdesign.com)**

## Design
- Single channel point-to-point optical communication link
- Single channel passive optical network (PON)
- Wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) point-to-point optical communication link

# Overview
## Design of optical communication systems involves optimizing a large number of parameters

- transmitters, optical fibers, amplifiers, receivers
- optical multiplexers, optical demultiplexers, optical filters, optical cross connects, optical add drop multiplexers
## Computer-aided design techniques if used appropriately
- optimize entire system
- provide optimum values of system parameters
- Design goals are met with minimal time and cost
## Commercially available design software packages
- Optiwave, VPITransmission Maker, Optisim

**Since mid-90â€™s, computer simulations have been used to realistically model optical communication systems**

# Optical Simulation Software

## Used to design and optimize
- DWDM and CWDM amplified systems
- FTTX/PON systems
- OTDM systems
- CATV digital/analog systems
- optical LANs
- ultra long-haul terrestrial and submarine systems
- free space optics (FSO) systems
### Optsim uses block-orientated simulation methodology:

- optical communication system is represented by an interconnected set blocks
- Each block models a component or subsystem 
- Each block model is presented graphically as an icon, has own set of parameters which can be modified by user Signal data is passed between block models during simulation run

### Each block model is simulated independently of the others
based only on signals passed into it and its own set of
parameters

### Each block model is presented graphically as an icon, has
own set of parameters which can be modified by user

### Extensive model library
- optical sources, optical modulators
- electrical and optical amplifiers
- fibers
- optical receivers
- optical cross connects, OADM
- data display tools (spectra, eye diagrams, BER)


# SIMULATION APPROACHES

- Optsim supports two simulation engines
- Block mode simulation engine: signal data is represented as one block of data and is passed between block to block
- Sample mode simulation engine: signal data is represented as single samples that is passed between block to block

# SIMULATION METHODS

**Four steps to setting up a simulation of a communication systems
- Create Optsim project and set simulation parameters
- Draw the schematic diagram, set parameter values of block models
- Run simulation
- View results with data display tools
