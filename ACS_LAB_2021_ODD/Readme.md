## Design
- Single channel point-to-point optical communication link
- Single channel passive optical network (PON)

# Overview
## Design of optical communication systems involves optimizing a large number of parameters

- transmitters, optical fibers, amplifiers, receivers
- optical multiplexers, optical demultiplexers, optical filters, optical cross connects, optical add drop multiplexers
## Computer-aided design techniques if used appropriately
- optimize entire system
- provide optimum values of system parameters
- Design goals are met with minimal time and cost
## Commercially available design software packages
- Optiwave, VPITransmission Maker, Optisim

**Since mid-90’s, computer simulations have been used to realistically model optical communication systems**

# Optical Simulation Software

## Used to design and optimize
- DWDM and CWDM amplified systems
- FTTX/PON systems
- OTDM systems
- CATV digital/analog systems
- optical LANs
- ultra long-haul terrestrial and submarine systems
- free space optics (FSO) systems
### Optsim uses block-orientated simulation methodology:

- optical communication system is represented by an interconnected set blocks
- Each block models a component or subsystem 
- Each block model is presented graphically as an icon, has own set of parameters which can be modified by user Signal data is passed between block models during simulation run

### Each block model is simulated independently of the others
based only on signals passed into it and its own set of
parameters

### Each block model is presented graphically as an icon, has
own set of parameters which can be modified by user

### Extensive model library
- optical sources, optical modulators
- electrical and optical amplifiers
- fibers
- optical receivers
- optical cross connects, OADM
- data display tools (spectra, eye diagrams, BER)


# SIMULATION APPROACHES

- Optsim supports two simulation engines
- Block mode simulation engine: signal data is represented as one block of data and is passed between block to block
- Sample mode simulation engine: signal data is represented as single samples that is passed between block to block

# SIMULATION METHODS

**Four steps to setting up a simulation of a communication systems
- Create Optsim project and set simulation parameters
- Draw the schematic diagram, set parameter values of block models
- Run simulation
- View results with data display tools

# EXPERIMENT - 4 [DATED : 25/02/2021]
**Design a 4 channel WDM system with the following specifications:**
-Channel spacing = 100 GHz (total bandwidth 6.4 THz)
-Transmission line rate = 10 Gb/s
-NRZ modulation format, 215-1 PRBS pattern length
-Transmission link length = 400 km
-The design goal is to achieve error free transmission (BER < 10-9) for all channels
- Design the transmitter and receiver modules, use of different ypes and combinations of fibers, location and number of EDFAs
deployed are your choice

**l parameters values must adhere to existing specifications in
data sheets which can be found on-line**

- Your report (max. 10 pages) must include
- a printout of the schematic diagram of the system
- the design methodology in order to achieve error free
transmission (BER < 10-9) for all channels
- printouts of the optical spectra of the multiplexed 64
channels at the 0 km, 200 km and 400 km mark
- printouts of BER plots (BER vs received optical power) of
the four channels, Channel 1, Channel 17, Channel 39
and Channel 64, and their corresponding eye diagrams at
BER = 10-9
- and any additional measurements to support your design

## FREE SPACE OPTICS

**The goal is to demonstrate a design in OptSim of Free-Space Optical Communication Link with a
free-space channel model based on weak-turbulence approximation.**

- Free-space optical (FSO) communications, also known as wireless optical communications, is a cost-effective and high
bandwidth access technique and has compelling economic advantages. 

- With the potential high-data-rate capacity, low cost and particularly wide bandwidth on unregulated spectrum, 
- FSO communications is an attractive solution for the “last mile” problem to bridge the gap between the end user and the fiber-optic infrastructure already in place.

- In FSO communications, optical transceivers communicate directly through the air to form point-to-point line-of-sight links. 
- The transmitter converts the electrical signal to an optical one and sends it through the atmosphere (free space).
- The receiver converts the optical signal back to an electrical signal. 
- The quality of the transmission line is characterized by the realized bit-error rate (BER).
