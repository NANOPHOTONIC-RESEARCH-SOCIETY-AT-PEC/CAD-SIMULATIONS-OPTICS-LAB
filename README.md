## CAD-SIMULATIONS-OPTICS-LAB
### This repository has to maintained and updated consistently related to the CAD-simulations that we do

## What you gonna do here ?
-----you gonna create a manual in such a way that any one us can refer to those points while performing the simulations again
-----you can also upload pdf or images to make it attractive
## Let us make an impact
## TOGETHER WE CAN DO IT

Here is my first addition to this repository that will include an understanding of electric-polarization conventions of a plane wave that runs behind most of these CAD-softwares dealing with electomagnetic anaysis

## Take a deep dove into our understanding of ELECTROMAGNETIC Plane Wave Analysis
AS THE TECHNOLOGY IS GROWING AND WE ARE HEADING TOWARDS THE ERA OF #quantumcomputing IT IS WORTH TO PAY ATTENTION TO THIS SMALL LOOKING BUT A CRITICAL NEED.

YES!

THE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITY OF MATHEMATICS BEHIND MAXWELL EQUATIONS AND THUS BRIDGE THE GAP FOR AN EFFICIENT DESIGN CONFIGURATION

"THE MORE COMPLEX THE CONFIGURATION, THE MORE IT IS DIFFICULT TO DESIGN"
