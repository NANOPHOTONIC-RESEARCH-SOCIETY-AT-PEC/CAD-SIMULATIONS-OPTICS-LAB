# CAD-SIMULATIONS-OPTICS-LAB
This repository has to maintained and updated consistently related to the CAD-simulations that we do

## What you gonna do here ?
you're gonna create a manual in such a way that any one us can refer to those points while performing the simulations again
you can also upload pdf or images to make it attractive
Let us make an impact

### TOGETHER WE CAN DO IT

Here is my first addition to this repository that will include an understanding of electric-polarization conventions of a plane wave that runs behind most of these CAD-softwares dealing with electomagnetic anaysis
