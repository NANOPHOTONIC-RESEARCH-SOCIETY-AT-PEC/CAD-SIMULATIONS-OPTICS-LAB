## CAD-SIMULATIONS-OPTICS-LAB
### This repository has to maintained and updated consistently related to the CAD-simulations that we do

## What you gonna do here ?
-----you gonna create a manual in such a way that any one us can refer to those points while performing the simulations again
-----you can also upload pdf or images to make it attractive
## Let us make an impact
## TOGETHER WE CAN DO IT

Here is my first addition to this repository that will include an understanding of electric-polarization conventions of a plane wave that runs behind most of these CAD-softwares dealing with electomagnetic anaysis
