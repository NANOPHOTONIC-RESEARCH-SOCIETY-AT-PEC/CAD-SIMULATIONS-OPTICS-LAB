## Take a deep dove into our understanding of ELECTROMAGNETIC Plane Wave Analysis
AS THE TECHNOLOGY IS GROWING AND WE ARE HEADING TOWARDS THE ERA OF #quantumcomputing IT IS WORTH TO PAY ATTENTION TO THIS SMALL LOOKING BUT A CRITICAL NEED.

YES!

THE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITY OF MATHEMATICS BEHIND MAXWELL EQUATIONS AND THUS BRIDGE THE GAP FOR AN EFFICIENT DESIGN CONFIGURATION
